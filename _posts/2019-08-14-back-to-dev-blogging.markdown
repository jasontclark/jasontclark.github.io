Although it would seem to be a failure when you stop, it is truly a failure when you do not begin again. That said, I've decided to give the #100DaysofCode challenge another go (pun intended).

This time the language of choice is (none other than) Go. As a IT professional in the modern world, dealing with cloud technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, it has become increasingly important to become an expert at Go. I do have some experience with the language, but for the sake of being thorough, I've gather several courses, tutorials, and various materials to "sharpen my blade".

I'm going to keep these posts short- there's no need to be extra wordy about my learnings, unless there is truly something remarkable to expand upon. I'm easily fascinated, so don't be surprised if there are a few lengthy posts. For now, let's see how things go tomorrow.
