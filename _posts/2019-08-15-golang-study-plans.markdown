So I took some time today to review my progress on the [Go Complete Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/go-the-complete-developers-guide). I didn't get very far the first time around- about 9% complete. There's room for improvement on that course for sure. However, I don't want to set out on this journey without a concrete plan. Without one, I'll end up taking a bunch of online courses, coding up a bunch of previously written examples, and none of the knowledge is truly sustained.  This time will be different.

I started by checking out the [Programmer's Competency Matrix](http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/). If you've never seen it before, I would encourage you to check it out. From my understanding, the matrix is not with out controversy, but I do think it provides a decent overview of what it means to have all-encompassing knowledge of a programming language or just being a programmer in general. For example, do you know how to construct data structures with your language of choice? Can you recognize and create algorithms with this language? Is your code organized and readable? The matrix covers common concepts that should be "in your wheelhouse" if you are considering yourself an expert programmer in the language.

In addition to considering the concepts from the competency matrix, I think it is also important to _build things_ with the language. Either that, or contribute to something that is being built.

That said, I think my next post will outline exactly what I plan to tackle over the next 100 days.
